# Fork Guards

The latest fork guards are made to fit the rally raid level 2 suspension kit (2mm increase on the total length on the fork). they should work on the stock forks but might be a bit longer then what you wanted.

## Caveats

For the best result, please use SLS or MDF printer with PA12 Nylon material. 
For the safety reason, please do check the sign of wear for the brake cable that run through the hoop on the left fork guard.
